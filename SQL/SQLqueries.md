from emp e2
where e2.sal > e1.sal
)
```

where rn=5
```
##  3 find the maximum salary from the EMP table without using functions.

select e1.sal from emp e1 inner join emp e2 on e1.sal<e2.sal
)
```

//first 8 rows
select emp.*, rownum, rowid from emp 
where rownum<=8;
```
# dup
##  6 select/delete duplicate rows from the EMP table
> rowid
> records with min(rowid) are  a unique set, others are dups
```sql

where rowid not in
(
select min(rowid) from emp group by empno
)

delete from emp
where rowid not in
(select min(rowid) from emp group by empno

select empno, ename, count(*)
from emp 
group by empno, ename
having count(*)>1
```
## 7 select only those employee information who are earning the same salary?
- 1st
```sql

```sql
select * from emp where sal in
(
select sal from emp group by sal having count(sal)>=2
)
```

where cnt>=2;
```

## 8 Display the employees where "more than 2 employees under a manager"
```sql
select * from 
(select emp.*, count(empno) over (partition by mgr) as cnt from emp)
where cnt>=2

//manager with its employee count
select e1.empno, e1.mgr, e2.cnt

select mgr, count(empno) cnt
from emp
group by mgr
having count(empno)>=2
order by cnt
) e2
on e1.mgr = e2.mgr

```
## 9 display even/odd number rows from a table
//first retrieve the rownum as a column RN
//if directly filter by mod(rownum,2), then it only retrieves the 1st row found
```sql
select * from
(select empno, ename, sal, rownum rn from emp order by empno)
where mod(rn, 2)!=0
order by rn
```

```sql
select * from emp where hiredate<= add_months(sysdate, -60);
```
##  12 find the LAST inserted record in a table.
>If you want the last record inserted, you need to have a timestamp or sequence number assigned to each
record as they are inserted and then you can use the below queryâ€¦
```sql

select * from emp
where empno = (
select max(empno) from emp
)
```
## max salary n dept name from each department
